## A need for improvised action and meaningful response from the game
However, they're not permissive in derailing the storyline.

### Emergent Gameplay:
Environment and AI simulation, which allow for interesting narrations. However, there's no authorships or no definiteive arc structure to this story. Therefore, select stories are only based on random chance.

## Approaches:

### Simulation Centric Approaches:
1. Design all characters  --> represented through logical steps
2. Define all interaction rules  --> represents transition between states
3. Simulate in an artificial environment

#### Rule-Types:
1. General Rules: A need for generalized rules is required so allowing agents to be interchangeable reducing code-load.
2. Choices: Basically given certain conditions you've preset choices to take in the world
3. Movement to location: Transition through locations:
4. Character interactions: allows inter-character relations to be affected

### Plot-Centric Approach:

Builds upon the simualation centric approach. And a definition of the narrative agenda.

We need a mediator and a generation. Generator here, would be the world similation.

As a graph we figure out which nodes are beats (necessary steps to reach the narrative agenda)

Mediation prevents one to move away from the storyline.

#### Replanning:
Automation which plans a subset of events which could potentially return us to the narrative agenda

### Moving to a discourse-centric approach

Interaction leads to stories which have the narrative agenda
