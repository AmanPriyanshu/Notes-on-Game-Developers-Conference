## TableTop Role-Playing Games:
Anologue games, where players focus on playing the game together.

## TTRPG are provocative!

## Indie TTRPG:
Player driven narratives
Bends entrenched concepts of play like:
	1. Winning/Losing
	2. Character control

### Narrative Mechanics:
Develop player collaboratively with the players.


#### Distributed control:

1. All players have authority -- involved vs uninvolved (What a Fiasco)
2. Put in own fictions to drive narrations. Basically say mini-stories to suggest/prompt other players to vote in your favour
3. Represent different pillars and pull/push (mechanics - allow GM functions through players)
4. Every player has role of particular things - like Ship, Ocean, etc. And upon uncertainity they choose what they do with it

### Fruitful Void:
Consider what not to narrate?

### Artifacts
- Automatic tweets about something that happened? --> Dialect becomes a language map (blurring the lines - lose language at end of game - basically something to last beyond the game)
- Take screenshots --> Collaborative cartography
